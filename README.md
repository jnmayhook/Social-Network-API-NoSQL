# Social-Network-API-NoSQL 

## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.  This application is a functional back-end built out very similarly to how a modern social network’s platform would be.  It utilizes the Model View Controller architecture and is built with Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js.  If there were a front-end to view, users would be able to share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.
